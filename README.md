# Assignment-6

## Project Description:
    - This project is a word frequency detecter, organizer and ranker, implemented with DOM and written in JS.
    - Was pretty difficult to figure out the various edge cases and situations where I had to tokenize separate words.
    - Parts of it were maybe overengineered, but I do think I could have improved the User interface.
